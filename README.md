# 🧠 Backend Development Assignments
---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a collection of assignments and exercises focused on **backend development using JavaScript/Node.js**.  
The goal is to solidify understanding of core backend concepts such as asynchronous programming, file system operations, and server basics.

---

## ✨ Concepts Covered / What You'll Find Here

### 🔹 JavaScript Fundamentals (Backend Context)
- Variables, Data Types, Operators
- Control Flow & Loops
- Functions
- Modules (CommonJS/ES Modules)

### 🔹 Asynchronous Programming
- Callbacks
- Promises (`promise.js`)
- Async/Await
- Sync vs Async operations (`Synchronous vs Asynchronous.txt`)

### 🔹 Node.js Core Modules
- File System (`fs` module)
- Event Emitters
- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)

### 🔹 Server Concepts (planned or in progress)
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- Handling requests and responses

### 🔹 Problem Solving
- Real-world coding challenges to apply backend concepts

## 💡 How to Run the Assignments

To run any of the JavaScript assignment files (`.js`) in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PoojithaJagadam/Backend-Assignments.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend-Assignments
    ```

3.  **Navigate into the specific assignment folder** you want to run (e.g., `D1-Task1`):
    ```bash
    cd D1-Task1
    ```

4.  **Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js:**
    ```bash
    node script.js
    ```
    *(Or `node promise.js`, depending on the file name)*
